## Configuration

### Custom Fields

To set custom fields like `Epic Link` and `Sprint`, you need to find their custom field IDs from your Jira instance. You can use the following methods:

1. **Jira REST API:**

   Use the following endpoint to retrieve all custom fields:

   ```
   GET https://your-jira-instance.com/rest/api/2/field
   ```

2. **Jira UI:**

   Navigate to Jira Admin > Issues > Custom Fields to find the custom field IDs.

   For more details, refer to the [Jira REST API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/).

### Environment Variables

Ensure that the environment variables in your `.env` file are correctly set. Important variables include:

- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token.
- `JIRA_SERVER`: Your Jira instance URL.
- `JIRA_USERNAME`: Your Jira username.
- `JIRA_PASS`: Your Jira password or API token.
- `ALLOWED_USERS`: Comma-separated list of Telegram usernames allowed to use the bot.

### Permissions

- The bot's Jira user must have permissions to:
  - Create issues in the selected projects.
  - Browse projects.
  - Assign issues.
  - Transition issues.
  - View project roles and users.

## Troubleshooting

- **Field Not on Screen**: If you encounter errors related to fields not being on the appropriate screen, ensure that the fields are configured and available on the issue creation screen in Jira.

- **Authentication**: Ensure that your Jira credentials or API token are correct. If you're using an API token, you might need to replace your password with the token.

- **Assignee Not Found**: If the bot cannot find the assignee, check that the user exists in Jira and has the necessary permissions.

- **Permissions**: Ensure that the bot's Jira user has sufficient permissions to access project roles, users, and create issues.

- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Jira's API rate limits when fetching large amounts of data.
